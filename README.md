Happy to share my project on Power BI


ðŸš€ Credit Card Sales Dashboard ðŸ“Š

I am excited to showcase project where I utilized Power BI to create a comprehensive sales dashboard for Credit card Sales. This dynamic dashboard provides an in-depth analysis of key performance indicators (KPIs) to drive informed business decisions. 

Process and key takeaways:
-> Upload data on MySQL database then use ODBC Connector to connect the MySQL with the PowerBI Desktop
-> Use DAX query to cleaning and preparation of data and also created important measure that are required for visualization
-> For visualization take my inspiration from The Hundred (T20 league in England) for theme and color combination

Key Features:
ðŸ“ˆ Sales Performance: Visualized trends and patterns in revenue data to monitor performance across different periods.
ðŸ‘¥ Customer Insights: Analyzed demography and consumer behaviors on the basis of gender to enhance targeting strategies.
ðŸ’¹ Revenue Analysis: Broke down revenue by type of credit card, gender, regions, age, occupation, their education level and number of dependents. 
ðŸš€ Key Performance Indicators(KPIs): Highlighted revenue, Interest earned, average income and Customer Satisfaction Score (CSS)
This project has honed my skills in data visualization, analytical thinking, and business intelligence, and I'm excited to apply these insights to drive impactful decisions. Let's connect and explore opportunities in data analytics and visualization! ðŸ’¼ðŸ”—
